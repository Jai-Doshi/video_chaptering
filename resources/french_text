Hello friends and welcome to a new episode of Dizy French friends if you like our videos think you subscribe to the channel it's just a little click and it allows us to support and today we're going to ask the passersby if they use artificial intelligence in their everyday lives it's [music] party is you ever used artificial intelligence if I use it sometime for a few daily business signals that messes up the lives of all students What did they tell me that is soptp is that in everyday life you use artificial intelligence not at all not at all you do what in asia i am head of school and it might not serve you hard to work with teachers ah and even in your personal life you have fun not to ask questions in chat gpt also i am your bad customer today is that in everyday life you use artificial intelligence absolutely no Right now I'm not there and in the people around you and no one uses artificial intelligence software so if ah yeah yeah some friends but that's ok and you but you're not refractory but the occasion it's not yet presented exactly not refractory but no chance for now is that you've ever used artificial intelligence uh yeah i'm using it a little bit in my work even pretty often yeah but to learn the more precise languages no Social networks that's pretty convenient for that is that and what software in particular uh chat GPT and then a little bit about kenva now they have a they have artificial intelligence tools that are integrated in there pretty convenient and since it's free for me I use it is that you use artificial intelligence in everyday life uh no no specifically not more than that at all not more than not really you ever asked chat questions about GPT to test but not on a daily basis ok you work in what in teaching and it can't be it wouldn't be because uh not seeing that I would the sciences it's not very useful in fact I think that you use artificial intelligence sometimes you can't see that it's not useful if you never even tried it No no you never tried no no no no no i don't know what it's called yes no no no no no no okay and because you think it would be useful to you because i saw you do it's funny but it's already scary so no i don't think about it any more than scary in what sense because it can write whole articles write poems and it's terrible because it's what we got left over a little i'll tell you to write ourselves and then there's yes it's quite possible to progress in french using an artificial intelligence software like chat gpt for example by asking for explanations of a grammar point but for a living this software doesn't make progress in improving your human interaction skills we're recommending that you learn itoki in this language Itoki itoki is a language course platform that has been validated by many of our learners to make rapid progress in French on itoki you can find the French teacher who is right for you pick a course at a time that suits you and enjoy a favorable rate the best way to get your opinion is to try it again then go through our link goitalky.com/easy frrench and you will get a credit of 10 dollars after spending 20 dollars on this platform take advantage of it is it you already have so much to do homework really to ask that we produce something because they do not the professors they have a software to write it down so if we really use it as a sentence and use the structure it is going to take more time to do it So as long as we do it ourselves it's going to be more than that it's really taking the elements to understand and after re-doing n I think once in terminal I had to do a philo DM like that because I knew it wasn't going to be picked up but otherwise here you're using other software or then you're into others so there must be a photo matthew it must be aia I think of the shot yeah no I use other stuff or not you said what kind of software I think photomat I think is for matthews there ah or you How phot phot mat yeah it's written how photo and my collar it's red and you scan the equation and it's te it's putting you step by step how to solve the thing here's what you know as artificial intelligence software i know chat gpt mid journey what's what i know of other i'm pretty little informed finally about this but it's useful to what mid journey mid day it's to generate images it seems to me unlike chat gpto it's sure of text it's just uh it seems to me that recently there's a software that serves to generate videos but i know more it's called and you think it can have some drawbacks or side effects after that it's uh it's sure that if it's not for doing dissertations or forcing things to work it's really hard to think about it it's how it's done uh it's really hard to do it Well yeah that's it does the work instead of the student it's not necessarily great forc uh after that can help I think as a starting point to think about artistic things it can prevent the white page syndrome or that's it but so I don't know I don't necessarily have a decision you write a lot in your daily life yes yes I have yes yes that's all for work or the uh no I personally write things about the text chronicles here I don't know and so it seems scary to say that there's a software that can do something similar that is yes that's true that it's not generally clear that we're going to do a lot of things in the human mind and it's not really a thing that we're going to do if we're going to do something that's very artificial That's a little bit of what we have left of beautiful we're going to say and that an artificial intelligence is starting to be able to do that and that's no it's not very clear I'm sorry if it's clear yeah yeah yeah and you think it might just replace writers ah I hope not I hope not it's left us our lived our sensations and that's it but well I think if we record in it they're also going to have the sensations and ideas of living so I don't know I hope not and then what professions can be made a little bit threatened by artificial intelligence all professions that in all professions graduate actually at the end of the day whether the doctors first we think there will ever be directors or visual designers or visual designers or even how the designers and photographers are all about this How to say visual designer visual designers and so on cinematography even in fact the directors of photography and c photo directors and so on these are all occupations that are on the point in one in one in a tunnel quite quite I dangerous perilous yes an imminent danger to them and you are doing the right thing that is that yes and first of all the lawyers too but there is a rather particular paradox for the lawyers because throughout history no matter what changes or technological developments institutional societal the lawyers have always been always those who have been able to pull their pin from the game complicating things a little bit more and so on and so forth so I am still optimistic for the word lawyer because this is the case I have not looked at the friends of the civil society in fact if we have the main episodes of rains If I don't shell out the word these are the main scammers in fact of human civilization thank you so much friends for watching our episode we hope you enjoyed it tell us in comments if you use artificial intelligence software and if so which and what it's for don't forget to put a little like on this video and subscribe to our channel and we'll tell you next week soon [Music]
